# ✓ _discloser_

## Overview

**_discloser_** is a web application designed to help users manage and share their sexual health information securely. It enables users to track STI test results, set automated testing reminders, and access basic educational resources, all while maintaining privacy and promoting informed consent.

### Problem Space

Sexual health conversations and STI status sharing can be awkward, inconsistent, and sometimes avoided altogether. Current methods of sharing test results often involve showing private medical documents that contain sensitive personal information beyond what's necessary. Additionally, many people struggle with maintaining regular testing schedules and notifying previous partners when necessary.

**Key issues:**

- Difficulty in sharing STI test results while protecting privacy.
- Lack of streamlined tools for managing and viewing test results.
- Inconsistent testing schedules due to lack of reminders.
